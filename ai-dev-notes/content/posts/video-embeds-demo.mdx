# Video Embeds Demo

This post demonstrates how to embed YouTube and Loom videos in your MDX posts with lazy loading for better performance.

## YouTube Embed

Here's how to embed a YouTube video using just the video ID:

<YouTube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up" />

You can also use a full YouTube URL - the component will extract the ID automatically:

<YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Full URL)" />

## Loom Embed

For Loom videos, you can use the video ID:

<Loom id="a1b2c3d4e5f6" title="Demo Loom Video" />

## Benefits of Lazy Loading

These video embeds implement lazy loading, which means:

- **Faster initial page load** - Videos only load when clicked
- **Reduced bandwidth usage** - Thumbnails are much smaller than video players
- **Better user experience** - Users choose when to load videos
- **SEO friendly** - Page loads quickly for search engines

## Image with Caption

You can also include images with captions using the standard img tag:

![AI Development Workflow](/images/ai-development.jpg "A typical AI development workflow")

## Usage in MDX

To use these components in your MDX files, simply include them like this:

```mdx
<YouTube id="your-video-id" title="Your video title" />
<Loom id="your-loom-id" title="Your Loom video title" />
![Alt text](/path/to/image.jpg "Optional caption")
```

The components handle various URL formats automatically, so you can use either the video ID or the full URL.
