# Welcome to AI Development Notes

This is the inaugural post of my AI development blog! Here I'll be sharing my journey through the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and modern development practices.

## What to Expect

- **Technical deep-dives** into AI frameworks and tools
- **Hands-on tutorials** for building AI applications
- **Best practices** for ML engineering and deployment
- **Insights** from working with LLMs and other AI models

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of using AI in JavaScript:

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

async function generateText(prompt) {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    model: "gpt-4",
  });
  
  return completion.choices[0].message.content;
}
```
